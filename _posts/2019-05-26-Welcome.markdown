Hey everyone!

I'm Sam Nolan, a software developer who is trying to live a normal life
without using any graphical utilities on my computer.

That means:
  - No Windows
  - No Mouse
  - No Graphical Browsers

![Screenshot of me getting Jekyll working](/shellmesilly/assets/jekyllshot.png)

All text based (except for framebuffer image viewers).

Now the right question to ask here would be **WHY**? And to be honest,
I currently don't have an answer to that question, I'll see how well this
works and report later.

The main idea is that doing things with only a shell and a keyboard 
makes the every day tasks nearly impossible. But as your interface is in
itself a scripting language, you only have to do everything **once**.
Once you're done with it, you can put it in a script and parameterise it.
So in theory, as I stay within a shell like environment, everything should
get more efficient and faster. 

Another good thing is that it encourages doing automated testing for
applications such as websites and games, as it's often the only way
that you can even use the application in the first place.

And finally, it's a lot less power intensive, nice on the CPU, and
runs on low spec computers. The text based browsers (such as [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/))
often have a much lower footprint too, meaning that websites load quicker.

Anyway, I'll be back here with tool recommendations and tutorials, as
well as other crazy stuff that I come up with.

Thanks for reading my first article.
